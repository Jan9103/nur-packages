# nushell-preview

This package was forked from this NUR's nushell package (which was forked from nixpkgs)

The unstable version contains a unreleased version.  
Please keep this in mind before posting any bug report!

Unstable vs preview: unstable patches nushell and deactivates the tests,
since those require a newer version of rust than the one used by nix.
